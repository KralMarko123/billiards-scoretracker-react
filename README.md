# BILLIARDS-SCORETRACKER-REACT

Hello, this is a little project I made because me and my friends were in desperate need of a way to keep track during pool games. Also this project was a way for me to practice the newest tools I learned in react. 

## TOOLS USED
 - React
 - Context API
 - useReduce()
 - Dynamically adding css classes through props (needs work)
 - SCSS
